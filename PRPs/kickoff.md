## Request:
I'm starting a new SaaS landing page project from scratch. Use the ux-researcher agent to help me:

- Create optimal layouts for dual-view (board/calendar) interface
- Design card components that show all required info efficiently
- Plan smooth transitions between views
- Design mobile-responsive layouts
- Save all wireframes to /docs/01-ux-research/wireframes/
- Document interaction patterns in /docs/01-ux-research/interaction-patterns.md

Do not use web search for any phase of this project.

## My SaaS product: 
Lemonoid is an AI-powered customer intelligence platform that aggregates, analyzes, and transforms customer reviews into actionable business insights and revenue driven recommendations. It also analysis competitors around and gives recommendations on what they're doing right/wrong, and spots opportunities

### Success Metrics
- **Revenue Impact**: 15-25% increase in customer satisfaction scores within 6 months
- **Customer Retention**: 20% improvement in repeat customer rates
- **Operational Efficiency**: 60% reduction in time spent on manual review analysis
- **Market Position**: Improved competitive ranking within local markets
- **User Adoption**: 80% active monthly usage rate among subscribers

## Target Market
Main customers will be cafes, restaurants, bars, hotels, spas, salons, autoshops, gyms, etc... basically any business that has reviews and would benefit from the analysis
